1. Problem Statement

In Ethiopia:

Catering, event services, transport, labor, cleaning, and rentals are high-demand

Clients struggle to find reliable vendors

Vendors struggle to get consistent, high-paying clients

Middlemen take high commissions without value

No trusted “hub” that works like ride-hailing logic for services

2. Solution Overview (WarkaHub)

Request → Match → Confirm → Deliver → Pay
